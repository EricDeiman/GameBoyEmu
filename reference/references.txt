DMG_ROM.bin  claims to be original GameBoy startup ROM built into the device

The Game Boy CPU is clocked at 4.194303 MHz
4,194,303 cycles per second is .0000002384186 seconds per cycle
A nanosecond is                .000000001 seconds
So, each cycle is 238 nanoseconds

Look into std::chrono, std::chrono::duration, and std::this_thread::sleep_for or 
std::this_thread::sleep_until

The HALT instruction puts the CPU into a low energy state that responds to interrupts,
 while the STOP insruction stops the system clock until a button is pressed.

The divider runs at 16384 Hz.  So, the system clock ticks 256 times for the
divider to tick once
